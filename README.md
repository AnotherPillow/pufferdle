A Wordle Clone Based on Stardew Valley Fishing

# Intro
I've been wondering if certain difficult fish could be caught perfectly in Stardew Valley, but it wasn't worth attempting since those fish were rare and I'd fail 99% of the times, making each attempt a big waste of time. I wanted some kind of "practice" mode where I could just select the fish I wanted to catch and try it as much as possible.

While I was thinking about implementing that practice mode (the Fish Tank) into a React website, I thought to combine the fishing minigame with Wordle. When I reel in a fish while playing Stardew Valley, I always try to guess what it is before the game finishes based off of the difficulty of the game. If it's too easy, it's probably a carp. If it's hard it might be what I'm looking for. Since I was already guessing the fish just while playing the game, I figured it would be a pretty natural extension into Wordle.

# Tools
This website was built in React using create-react-app.

The only other thing of note was using [MainLoop.js](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js/) for the fishing minigame game loop.
